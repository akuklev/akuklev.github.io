WIP: Bounded Inductive Construction Calculus
============================================

Proofs of the properties of formal systems are commonly carried out in weak predicative arithmetic systems such as PRA
(Primitive Recursive Arithmetic) using Gödel numberings (1931), an assignment of a unique natural number to each symbol
and well-formed formula of some formal language.
However the necessity to go through coding makes the proofs considerably more tedious and introduces a reasoning gap.

Recent advances in type theories allow to address these issues. Primitive recursive dependent type theory
Tᴾᴿ<sup>[[BB24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01011)]</sup> is a conservative extentsion of the PRA supporting finitary
inductive types and type families comprising a small universe `FData` lacking function types, and one Π-closed
universe `Type` above.

Finitary inductive type families are direct representations of abstract formal languages and
come with structural induction principles, a tidy and natural way to define translations and reason about expressions.

In Tᴾᴿ it is possible to define inductive types capturing the syntax of arithmetic and a proof calculus for classical
first order logic. Then we can both prove the consistency of the Peano Arithmetic relative to the ε₀-induction principle 
(which can be stated in Tᴾᴿ very naturally, cf. the original paper) and define its Dialectica Interpretation in a very
readable and fully mechanized way without reasoning gaps.

Tᴾᴿ can naturaly state (but not prove) its own consistency. Let `Prf : FData` be the inductive type of its own proofs
together with a type family `Conclusion : Prf → Type`. Hilbert-style consistency is a states that conclusion of
every proof is not false.
```
  ∀(prf : Prf) ¬¬Conclusion(prf)
```

Classically, it is equivalent to its constructively stronger form, a dependent function
```
  eval : ∀(prf : Prf) Conclusion(prf)
```

Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem seems to rule out theories that can prove their own Hilbert-style consistency,
but the recently developed finitary set theory H˂ʷ [Pakhomov19] uses a loophole of Gödel’s result
and proves its own consistency.
Its proof cannot be verified in its entirety because the syntactical encoding of the very proofs
(“Gödel numbering”) lies outside the scope of set theoretic language.
We want to address this shortcoming by developing a type-theoretic counterpart of Pakhomov's
finitary set theory.

# Universes, finitary set theory

In type theories, types containing other types are known as universes.
A universe is called hereditary if the types it contains are (1) themselves universes (2) hereditary ones.
Pure set theories can be understood as type theories where all types
(besides the universe of proposition Prop) are hereditary universes.
Well-founded pure set theories are the ones where ∈-induction for hereditary universes is derivable.

Type theories, in particular the ones with infinite universe hierarchies have rule schemata
producing a (r.e.) infinite number of rules, e.g. 
```
–––––————–––––(UH)      –——––––————–––—(UC)
 Γ ⊢ Uⁿ : Uⁿ⁺            Γ ⊢ Uⁿ ⊆ Uⁿ⁺
```
Finitary set theory H˂ʷ [Pakhomov19] features the schemes (UH) and (UA) from above defining 
a cumulative hierarchy of hereditary universes containing at least n elements for each finite n,
the operation of completion V for hereditary universes U:
```
 Γ ⊢ T : U     U' ⊆ V(T)
–––––————––––––––————–––—
     Γ ⊢ U' : V(U)
```

Additionally,
it contains the type of propositions implementing classical predicate logic with equality
and reflecting ∈-relation for hereditary universes.
Hereditary universes can be filtered by predicates (separation).
∈-induction for predicates can be classically derived.

It appears that generalizing `Prop` to a generic impredicative universe `*`
(that contains polymorphic functions besides propositions) is a conservative extension.


# Local finiteness and inductive hierarchies

A theory is called locally finite iff any of its finite subtheories
(take any finite number of axioms generated by schemata) have finite models.
It is precisely the locally finite theories that can evade the shackles of Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem.
As exemplified by H˂ʷ,
a locally finite theory can be powerful enough to define query functions on finite domains
(think of database queries applicable to finite tables),
but a locally finite type theory cannot feature provably infinite types,
but it is still possible to allow inductive definitions.
Instead of defining types, they will define inductive hierarchies,
that is cumulative hierarchies of finite “bounded inductive” types approximating the intended inductive type.

Our idea is to use terms of other bounded inductive types as levels of approximation.
That is for every inductive definition `J` and some term `n : T` of some bounded inductive type,
we will have a bounded inductive type Jⁿ of J-terms
that can be constructed from n using non-increasing structural induction.
This way we will have
```
      Γ, n : T ⊢ t' : Jⁿ
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
 Γ, n : T, t : Jⁿ ⊢ Jᵗ ⊆ Jⁿ
```
i.e. essentially we have `t : Jᵗ`.


# Towards consistency via finite partial models

We hope
to generalize the completion operator V from hereditary universes to terms of arbitrary inductive types
so that Vᵗ is precisely the finitary hereditary universe where all bounded inductive types Jᵗ can be modelled.

Since every proof `t : Prfⁿ` is finite,
it can be carried out already inside the finite partial model `Vⁿ` of our theory.
Checking a proof inside a finite model is a case of a query evaluation on a finite domain,
so it should be possible to define the level-polymorphic function `evalⁿ : ∀(t : Prfⁿ) → Conclusion(prf)`,
yielding the strong Hilbert-style consistency `eval : ∀(t : Prfᵗ) → Conclusion(prf)`.

# Aspired Applications

We want
to develop Bounded Inductive Construction Calculus
to be a trusted finitistic core theory to carry out metamathematical proofs.
It seems, in most cases bi-interpretability and conservativity proofs can be carried out unconditionally.

We intend to develop a logic-free formalization for the finitary set theory H˂ʷ and its intuitionistic variant CH˂ʷ
(see https://akuklev.github.io/finitistic-core) and show their bi-interpretability with BICC.
Then we intend
to develop its extensions CH˂ᶿ for computable ordinals θ to gauge consistency strength of predicative theories,
e.g. show bi-interpretability of Peano Arithmetic with CH˂ᵋ⁰ and thus its consistency modulo ε₀-induction.
Consistency of impredicative theories is measured relative to set theories with some higher infinity axioms
(existence of universes with given closure properties),
so we hope to develop appropriate extensions of H˂ʷ with a fixed number, a countable hierarchy,
or an ordinal-indexed hierarchy of universes with given properties
to use for bi-interpretability proofs with impredicative theories.

We intend to use BICC to prove the soundness of HCCC, namely typechecking decidability, normalization,
canonicity, and conservativity over M. Shulman’s “Set theory for category theory” ZMC/𝕊,
which also yields relative consistency.
The same should be carried out for restricted variants of HCCC,
namely the one conservative over Tarski-Grothendieck set theory,
the one conservative over ZFC and the strongest known predicative variant
(extended predicative Mahlo universes, but no propositional resizing).
Weak variants conservative over major reverse mathematics systems should be also isolated.

We hope
BICC might be the right choice
to develop an extensive body of mechanized proofs of major results regarding conservativity,
relative consistency, independence, forcing, realizability, ordinal analysis, and reverse mathematics.
