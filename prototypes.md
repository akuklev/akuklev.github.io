Building on the unpublished ideas of C. McBride and ideas from ‚ÄúDisplayed Type Theory and Semi-Simplicial Types‚Äù
by A. Kolomatskaia and M. Shulman, we propose a novel extension for univalent Martin-L√∂f Type Theories (MLTTs)
that allows internalizing Reedy categories.

Indexing and fibering over shape types provide effective machinery to deal with syntaxes that include binding
and become indispensable when internalizing the syntax and semantics of type theories themselves.
In this way, we obtain a convenient tooling and uniformly establish the existence of initial models for structures
like [weak œâ-categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02866), [virtual equipments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08663), 
(‚àû,1)-toposes
once the [Higher Observation Type Theory (HOTT)](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+observational+type+theory)
is complete.

Finally, this approach should lead to a homoiconic univalent type theory (see ‚ÄúType Theory should eat itself‚Äù),
i.e. one capable of representing its own syntax as a generalized inductive type
and thus also performing structural induction over it.

# Motivation

Finitary type families abstractly embody formalized languages.
For example, consider the following simple language of arithmetic
and logical expressions:
```
data ExpressionKind
  Numeric
  Logical

data Expr : ‚ÜìExpressionKind
  Literal(n : Int)          : Expr(Numeric)
  Sum(a b : Expr(Numeric))  : Expr(Numeric)
  Mul(a b : Expr(Numeric))  : Expr(Numeric)
  Div(a b : Expr(Numeric))  : Expr(Numeric)
  Pow(a b : Expr(Numeric))  : Expr(Numeric)
  Neg(a : Expr(Numeric))    : Expr(Numeric)
  Log(a : Expr(Numeric))    : Expr(Numeric)
  
  Eq(a b : Expr(Numeric))   : Expr(Logical)
  Less(a b : Expr(Numeric)) : Expr(Logical)
  And(a b : Expr(Logical))  : Expr(Logical)
  Or(a b : Expr(Logical))   : Expr(Logical)
  Not(a b : Expr(Logical))  : Expr(Logical)
```

This approach scales up to languages that may declare and bind named
entities (variables, constants, internal types) including general-purpose
programming languages themselves.

Data types defined that way are inhabited by abstract syntax trees
corresponding to finite expressions of the language, and they come
with a recursive descent analysis operator that enabling
type-driven design of correct-by-construction analysers and interpreters.
This includes type checking, compilation, control flow analysis,
as well as static analysis and abstract interpretation in general.

As for IDEs, inductive type families enable designing biparsers for
those languages, i.e. parsers that maintain one-to-one mapping
between the source code and the respective annotated abstract syntax
tree, enabling both fast incremental reparsing and mechanized refactoring.

* * *

To represent languages with typed variables, one introduces the type `Ty`
representing variable types in the language, and the type family `Tm : ‚ÜìCtx`
of terms in a given context, where contexts are lists of types `Ctx := Ty*`.
Definition of term substitution can be vastly simplified if we make the type
`Ctx` of contexts fibered over the shape type `LaxNat` that enables context
extension and selection of subcontexts.

In case of dependently typed languages, the we‚Äôll have a type family `Ty : ‚ÜìCtx`
of variable types available in a given context `c : Ctx`, and the type of contexts
is an iterated dependent pair type
```
data Ctx
  Empty : Ctx
  Append(prefix : Ctx, head : Ty prefix)
```
fibered over the shape type Œî that enables context extension and
selection of subcontexts and respecting type dependencies, which is
a absolutely vital for the definition of the aforementioned type family
`Ty : ‚ÜìCtx` and the type family `Tm : ‚Üì(c : Ctx, Ty c)` of terms of a
given type in a given context.

Bi-directionally typed languages (computational type theories) also
require a fibered type family `Redex : ‚Üì(c : Ctx) ‚Üë(ty : Ty c, Tm ty) `
of reducible expressions together with a function 
`|r : Redex| : Œ£(ty : Ty c) Tm ty` that computes their normal forms.

Now as we have motivated the need for all this stuff, let's dive in.

# Setting and basics

Our base theory will be the Higher Observational Type Theory with an infinite tower of cumulative
universes `* : *‚Å∫ : *‚Å∫‚Å∫ : ¬∑¬∑¬∑` featuring ‚ñ°-modality-based polymorphism.

All universes will be closed under dependent product, dependent sum types, and
quotient inductive types.

The simplest types of this kind are the finite datatypes (also known as enums) defined by enumerating
their possible values:
```
data Bool
  True    `tt`
  False   `ff`
  
data Unit
  Point
  
data Void
  # no elements at all 
```

We can generalize them to sum types by allowing infinite families of ‚Äúpossible values‚Äù
parametrized by some other type:
```
data Possibly<X>
  Nothing
  Value(x : X)
```

Each inductive type comes along with a dual typeclass:
```
typeclass Bool·¥ø<this Y>
  true  : Y
  false : Y
```
```
typeclass Possibly·¥ø<X, this Y>
  nothing : Y
  value(x : X) : Y
```

Instances of these typeclasses represent by-case analysis of the respective sum types.

Inhabitants of inductive types `x : T` can be converted into functions
evaluating their by-case analysers: `x·∂ú : ‚àÄ<Y : T·¥ø> Y`:
```
def True·∂ú<Y : Bool·¥ø>() = Y.true
def False<Y : Bool·¥ø>() = Y.false

def Nothing·∂ú<X, Y : Possibly·¥ø<X>>()  = Y.nothing
def Value<X, Y : Possibly·¥ø<X>)(x : X)·∂ú  = Y.value(x)
```

These functions are known as Church representations.

What if we want to return values of different types for `True` and `False`?
If we have universes (types of types), we can first define a function from
booleans into some universe `R : Bool ‚Üí ùí∞` and then a dependent case analyser
```
typeclass Bool·¥π<this Y : Bool ‚Üí *>
  true  : Y(True)
  false : Y(False)
```

To apply dependent case analysers to inhabitants of the respective type we
need special operator called induction for reasons explained below:
```
I-ind<Y : I·¥π>(x : I) : Y(x)
```

Non-finite inductive types admit (strictly positive) recursion in type definitions,
allowing introduce such types as natural numbers, lists, and trees:
```
data Nat `‚Ñï`
  Zero `0`
  Next(pred : ‚Ñï) `pred‚Å∫`
```
```
data List<T> `T*`
  EmptyList : T*
  NonEmptyList(head : T, tail : T*) : T*
```
```
data BinTree<T>
  Leaf
  Node(label: T, left : BinTree<T>, right : BinTree<T>)
```
```
data VarTree<T>
  Leaf
  Node(label: T, branches : VarTree<T>*)
```
```
data InfTree<T>
  Leaf
  Node(label: T, branches : Nat ‚Üí InfTree<T>)
```

All above examples except infinitely branching trees are finitary inductive types,
i.e. inductive types with the property that all of their generators have a finite
number of parameters, and all these parameters are of finitary inductive types.
Finitary inductive types may be infinite, but their inhabitants can be encoded
by natural numbers or, equivalently finite bit strings.

Finitary inductive types embody single-sorted languages.
They are inhabited by abstract syntax trees corresponding to finite expressions
of the language formed by their generators.

‚ÄúCase analysis‚Äù for the type of natural numbers provides n-ary iteration operator:
```
typeclass Nat·¥ø<this Y>
  zero : Y
  next(p : Y) : Y
```
Analysing a natural number `n` by `R : Nat·¥ø<Y>` yields `n·∂ú<R>() = (R.next)‚Åø R.zero`,
allowing to iterate arbitrary functions given number of times. In general,
‚Äúcase analysis‚Äù turns into ‚Äúrecursive descent analysis‚Äù. For lists and trees we
obtain the respective fold operators.

Type-valued functions on natural numbers `Y : Nat ‚Üí ùí∞` can encode arbitrary predicates,
and a dependent `Nat`-analyser `Nat·¥π<Y>` encodes an induction motive: it establishes
a proof of the base case `Y(zero)` and the inductive step `Y(n) ‚Üí Y(n‚Å∫)`.
Dependent case analysis operator turns induction motives into to proof the predicate
for all natural numbers, that is why it is also known as induction operator.
The presence of induction witnesses that inductive types contain only inhabitants that
can be obtained by finite compositions of their generators.
Which is also the reason why data types described in terms of their generators are
called inductive types.

While ordinary inductive types are freely generated by their generators,
quotient inductive types may additionally contain constructors of identities
between inhabitants.

This way we can define rational numbers and unordered collections:
```
data Rational
  frac(num : Int, den : PosInt)
  expand<num, den>(n : PosInt) : frac(num, den) = frac(num ¬∑ n, den ¬∑ n)
  
data Collection<T>
  bagOf<n : FinType>(items : n ‚Üí T)
  permute<n, items>(p : n!) : bagOf(items) = bagOf(items ‚àò p)
```
where `n!` is the type of automorphisms on the type `n`, i.e. permutations in case of finite types.

That is, in addition to listing generators, we require that some actions
on generators (expanding the fraction or permuting list elements) must
be irrelevant for all predicates and functions defined on these types.

# Type families and inverse categories

For a type `J : ùí∞` let `J·µà` denote the respective universe of type families indexed by `J`.
A typical example is length-indexed lists:
```
data Vec<T> : Nat·µà
  nil : Vec<T> 0
  cons<n>(head : T, tail : Vec<T> n) : Vec<T> n‚Å∫
```


Now consider the quotient inductive type of eventually-zero sequences:
```
data ZeroEndingSequence
  nil : ZeroEndingSequence
  append(prefix : ZeroEndingSequence, head : Nat)
  extend(f : ZeroEndingSequence) : f = append(f, 0)
```

As we have seen above, we can turn the type of lists to a length-indexed type family over `Nat`,
but we cannot make `ZeroEndingSequence` into a type family over `Nat` because
`extend` generates equality between ‚Äúlists‚Äù of different lengths. We need
a ‚Äúlax‚Äù index type instead of `Nat`:
```
shape LaxNat
  lax(n : Nat) : LaxNat
  lax(n) [m : Nat‚ü© lax(n + m)
  [n‚ü© [m‚ü© ‚Ü¶ [(n +) m‚ü©
```

To each universe `ùí∞` we'll have an associated shape universe `$ùí∞` occupied by the types like the one
above. Inductive shape types are stratified directed counterparts of quotient inductive types.
For every pair of their elements `x y : T` of a set-like type `T : ùí∞` there is a type `(x = y) : ùí∞`
of identifications between `x` and `y`.

Shape types `S : $ùí∞` admit extender types instead: for every element `s : S`,
there is a type family `s‚Üë : P·µà`. We will write `s ‚Üë t` for `s‚Üë t`.

Quotient inductive types admit constructors of identities `x = y` between their elements. 
Shape types allow constructors of extenders like `s [n‚ü© t` that generate inhabitants 
of the type `s ‚Üë t`. Sources of extenders must be structurally smaller than their targets
to enable typechecking. Whenever we define an extender `s [n‚ü© t` , we must also
define how it acts on all possible extenders `e : t ‚Üë t'` yielding
some `[f n‚ü© : s ‚Üë t'`. This action must be given by some function `f`
so ensure associativity by construction (because function composition is).

This way, shape types form strictly associative inverse categories.

Every function we define on a shape type must have an action on all constructors,
including extender constructors, which amounts to functoriality.

To have an example, let us define addition for
`LaxNat`s:
```
def add : LaxNat¬≤ ‚Üí LaxNat
  (lax(n), lax(m)) ‚Ü¶ lax(m + n)
  (n[k‚ü©, m) ‚Ü¶ add(n, m) [k‚ü©
  (n, m[k‚ü©) ‚Ü¶ add(n, m) [k‚ü© 
```

With `LaxNat` we can transform `ZeroEndingSequence` into a type family:
```
data ZeroEndingSizedSequence : ‚ÜìLaxNat
  nil : ZeroEndingSizedSequence lax(0)
  append<n>(prefix : ZeroEndingSizedSequence n, head : Nat) : ZeroEndingSizedSequence (lax(1) + n) 
  extend<n>(f : ZeroEndingSizedSequence n) : ???
```

Before we fill in the gap in the above definition, note that type families also seem to be functions on their index type,
so they must act on the extender constructors: they must map extender constructors to identities or extenders
between function results. Extenders between types are domain extension maps for functions defined
on those types, i.e. for a types `X Y : *`, the type `X ‚Üë Y` is `‚àÄ<Z> (X ‚Üí Z) ‚Üí (Y ‚Üí Z)`.
Let `F : I·µà` be a type family, and `e : s ‚Üë t` for some `s t : I`.
Then `F(e) : ‚àÄ<Y> (F(s) ‚Üí Y) ‚Üí (F(t) ‚Üí Y)`. We also have a dependently typed version.
```
F(e) : ‚àÄ<Y : F(s)·µà> (‚àÄ(x : F(s)) Y(x)) ‚Üí (‚àÄ(x : F(t)) F(e) Y)(x))
```

Now we can fill in the gap in the definition of `ZeroEndingSizedSequence`. The type
of the equality constructor `f = append(f, 0)` does not typecheck yet, but we can
decompose it into an application `{ it = append(f, 0) } f` and apply the domain
extension to the function part by applying `ZeroEndingSizedSequence n[extend 1‚ü©`:
```
data ZeroEndingSizedSequence : LaxNat·µà
  nil : ZeroEndingSizedSequence lax(0)
  append<n>(prefix : ZeroEndingSizedSequence n, head : Nat) : ZeroEndingSizedSequence (lax(1) + n) 
  extend<n>(f : ZeroEndingSizedSequence n)
  : ZeroEndingSizedSequence n[extend 1‚ü© { it = append(f, 0) } f
```

# Lax algebraic theories via shapes

Models of single-sorted algebraic theories arise as dual typeclasses
for quotient inductive types we will call prototypes of those theories.
Monoids arise as models for the following type:
```
data MonoidPt
  e : MonoidPt
  (‚àò) : MonoidPt ‚Üí MonoidPt ‚Üí MonoidPt

  unitorL : x = e ‚àò x
  unitorR : x = x ‚àò e
  associator : (x ‚àò y) ‚àò z = x ‚àò (y ‚àò z)
```

We can also provide an unbiased definition for monoids, where the composition operation
is not taken to be binary, but can have any finite arity including zero for the neutral
element `e`. Let's introduce several types:
```
data PTree<T>
  Leaf(label : T)
  Node(branches : PTree<T>*)
```
```
data SizedPTree<T> : ‚Ñï·µà
  Leaf(label : T) : SizedPTree<T> 1
  Node<sizes : ‚Ñï*>(branches : HList<T> sizes) : SizedPTree<T> (sum sizes)
```
A `pr : Parenthesization(n : ‚Ñï)` is just a `SizedPTree<Unit> n` that acts
on lists `xs : T*` turning them into respective trees `pr(xs) : PTree<T>`.

Now we can proceed to the definition of an unbiased monoid:
```
shape MonoidPt
  compose : LaxMonoidPt* ‚Üí LaxMonoidPt

  expand(xs : LaxMonoidPt*,
         pr : Parenthesization xs.length
  : compose(xs) = (pr(xs) map compose)  
```

If we can orient equalities so they map structurally smaller terms to structurally
larger ones, we can reformulate the theory as a shape type with extenders instead
of identities. Algebraic theories with extenders are known as lax algebraic theories.
```
shape LaxMonoidPt
  compose : LaxMonoidPt* ‚Üí LaxMonoidPt

  compose(xs) [pr : Parenthesization xs.length‚ü© (pr(xs) map compose)

  [pr‚ü© [pr'‚ü© ‚Ü¶ [expand (pr' ‚àò) p‚ü©  
```

When mapping into set-like types, extenders can only be mapped into identities,
so exchanging identities for extenders does not affect set-like models, but the
lax formulation provides an explicitly confluent system of rules making the 
theory stratified. Stratifiability of the sort algebra is necessary for
generalized algebraic theories to have explicit syntactic free models and
an effective model structure on the category of their models.

# Fibered types and direct categories

Many operations on containers have the following property:
the shape of the resulting container only depends on the shapes of the arguments.
For example, length of the list computed by `concatenate`, `map`, and `reverse`
can be computed based on the lengths of the input lists.

To account for that let us introduce a notion of fibered types and functions between
them, namely the functions with the property described above.

A fibered type is given by a pair of a type `E` and a function `f : E ‚Üí B` written
as `E / f`.
We will denote the type of such terms as `E ‚Üì B` and occasionally `(e : E) ‚Üì B(e)`
in case of dependent functions.

Fibered types above some base type `B : ùí∞` form a type family `‚ÜìB` and `E ‚Üì B := ‚ÜìB E`
is just a reverse application:
```
data ‚ÜìB : ùí∞·µà
  (E : ùí∞) / (f : E ‚Üí B) : E ‚Üì B 
```

For example, we can take the type of lists `T*` and the function `length : T* ‚Üí ‚Ñï`:
`T* / length : T* ‚Üì ‚Ñï`. 

A function between fibered types is a pair of functions `(f / b) : (X / p) ‚Üí (Y / q)`,
so that the following square commutes by construction:
```
 X --[f]--> Y
 |p         |q
 V          V
 A --[b]--> B
```

Consider a few examples of functions on fibered types:
```
reverse<T> / id  : (T* / length)  ‚Üí (T* / length)
concat<T> / add  : (T* / length)¬≤ ‚Üí (T* / length)
flatten<T> / sum : (T* / length)* ‚Üí (T* / length)

map<X, Y>(f : X ‚Üí Y) / id : (X* / length)  ‚Üí (Y* / length)
```

Inductive-recursive definitions are mutually dependent definitions of an inductive type
and a recursive function on that type.
Such definitions naturally generate a fibered type.

**TODO:** Œ£-closed universe example

We will use `|_|` as the default name of fibering function unless it is explicitly named.

Fibered types allow formulating dependent extender types:
for a type `X : ùí∞` and a fibered type `Y : Y' / X`, extenders `X ‚Üë Y` are terms of the type
`‚àÄ<Z : X ‚Üí ùí∞> (‚àÄ(x : X) Z(x)) ‚Üí (‚àÄ(y : Y') Z(|y|))`.

`Œ£`-type former is tightly connected to fibered types.
On one hand, for every type family `Y : B·µà`, we have the fibered type `Œ£'Y / fst : Œ£Y ‚Üì B`.
On the other hand, `Œ£<J : ùí∞> : J·µà ‚Üí ùí∞` maps type families into types so for every J we have
a fibered type `J·µà / Œ£<J>`.

Above we only used the operator ( ·µà) on types `T : ùí∞` to denote type-families `T·µà`, but
this operator was actually introduced in ‚ÄúDisplayed Type Theory and Semi-Simplicial Types‚Äù
for all terms.
Let us extend its definition to fibered types as follows.
For `Y : (F / f)·µà`, where `f : F ‚Üí B`, and `x : F` let:
```
Y(x) : B·µà (f x) Y
```

–ïhe significance of this definition comes to light when we consider
that inductive types can be self-fibered:
```
shape ùîª : * ‚Üì ùîª
  fst / (Void / exfalso)
  snd / (Unit / { fst })
```

Here we define a type with two generators `fst` and `snd`, and a function `|x : ùîª| : (* ‚Üì ùîª)`,
i.e. for every generator `c` we have a type `|c|` fibered over `ùîª`.
For `fst`, this type `|fst|` is empty. For `snd`, `|snd|` is a unit type together with a function
mapping its unique element to `fst`.

Inductive self-fibered types form strictly associative direct categories. (TODO: Clarify)

A type family `Y : ‚Üì(ùîª / |¬∑|)` indexed over this type satisfies the following typing rule:
```
Y(x : ùîª) : (* ‚Üì ùîª)·µà |x| Y
```

Since `ùîª` only has two elements, we can split cases:
```
Y(fst) : (* ‚Üì ùîª)·µà |fst| Y
Y(snd) : (* ‚Üì ùîª)·µà |snd| Y
```
which in turn reduces to
```
Y(fst) : (* ‚Üì ùîª)·µà (Void / { it }) Y
Y(snd) : (* ‚Üì ùîª)·µà (Unit / { fst }) Y
```
further reducing to
```
Y(fst) : (‚àÄ(u / f : (Void / { it })) Y(f(u))) ‚Üí ùí∞
Y(snd) : (‚àÄ(u / f : (Unit / { fst })) Y(f u)) ‚Üí ùí∞
```

Product over empty domain is `Unit`, and the product over unit domain is just one element:
```
Y(fst) : Unit ‚Üí ùí∞
Y(snd) : Y(fst) ‚Üí ùí∞
```
So our type family is merely a dependent pair `Œ£(T : ùí∞) (T ‚Üí ùí∞)`!

With self-fibered index types we can define dependent pairs as dependent function types.
Signatures of theories with dependent sorts can be expressed as finite direct categories,
so first-order and higher-order theories with dependent sorts can be expressed as type
classes parametrized by such families.
Algebraic theories with dependent sorts can be
expressed via inductive type families indexed over a finite self-fibered index type S.
In particular categories are models of an algebraic theory over the shape
```
shape ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫ : * ‚Üë ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫
  Ob  / (Void / exfalso)
  Mor / (Bool / { Ob })
```

To deal with ‚àû-categories, one can introduce a shape types `CellType` containing cell types
of every dimension `n : Nat`.

Dually to our lax natural numbers, we can introduce a self-indexed type `Œî‚Å∫`:
```
shape Œî‚Å∫ : * ‚Üë Œî‚Å∫
  simplex(n : Nat) / ((Œ£(m) Fin(m) ‚Üí Fin(n)) / simplex(m))
```

Type families over Œî‚Å∫ are semi-simplicial types.
Type families over thin (i.e. with at most one arrow between any two inhabitants)
self-indexed types are also known as very dependent types.

# Combining extenders and selectors: Reedy categories

Most notably, we can combine extenders (degeneracy maps) and selectors (face maps)
yielding strictly associative Reedy categories like the simplicial category Œî:
```
shape Œî  : * ‚Üë Œî
  simplex(n : Nat) / ((Œ£(m) Fin(m) ‚Üí Fin(n)) / simplex(m))
  
  simplex(n)[m : Nat, f : Fin(m) ‚Üí Fin(n)‚ü© simplex(m) / (intertwining identities) 
  [m, f‚ü© [m', f'‚ü© ‚Ü¶ [m', { it ‚àò f } f'‚ü©
```

Type families on Œî are the infamous simplicial types,
which are vital for defining the syntax of dependent typed theories.

# Categories as models of a shape-indexed prototype

Let us again consider the category signature shape:
```
shape ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫ : * ‚Üë ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫
  Ob  / (Void / exfalso)
  Mor / (Bool / { Ob })
```

Just like we defined a monoid prototype above, we can define a prototype for categories as
an indexed quotient-inductive type family:
```
data CatPt : (‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫)·µà
  id : ‚àÄ(o : CatPt Ob) (CatPt Mor)(o, o)
  (‚ñ∏) : ‚àÄ(x y z : CatPt Ob) (CatPt Mor)(x, y)
                          ‚Üí (CatPt Mor)(y, z)
                          ‚Üí (CatPt Mor)(x, z)

  unitorL : ‚àÄ{x y} f = id ‚ñ∏ f
  unitorR : ‚àÄ{x y} f = f ‚ñ∏ id
  associator : ‚àÄ{f g h} (f ‚ñ∏ g) ‚ñ∏ h = f ‚ñ∏ (g ‚ñ∏ h)
```

The dual typeclass is precisely the usual definition of a category:
```
typeclass CatPt·¥ø<this Ts : (‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫)·µà>
  id : ‚àÄ<o> Ts.mor(o, o)
  (‚ñ∏) : ‚àÄ<x, y, z> Ts.mor(x, y)
                 ‚Üí Ts.mor(y, z)
                 ‚Üí Ts.mor(x, z}
  ... subject to unitality and associativity
```

Which is precisely the ordinary definition of a category that works perfectly in set-like types.
For a definition that works in arbitrary universes, we additionally have to require univalence.

As it turns out, it can be achieved by adding two extenders to the index shape type:
```
shape ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫ : * ‚Üë ‚ñ°¬π‚Å∫
  Ob  / (Void / exfalso)
  Mor / (Bool / { Ob })

  Ob [„ÇàR‚ü© Mor / ff
  Ob [„ÇàL‚ü© Mor / tt
```

Now given `Ts : (‚ñ°¬π)·µà`, for every `o : Ts.Ob` we'll have Yoneda embeddings:
```
o[„ÇàR‚ü© : ‚àÄ<target> Ts.Mor(o, target)
o[„ÇàL‚ü© : ‚àÄ<source> Ts.Mor(source, o)
```

These embeddings suffice to derive the said univalence requirement:
```
‚àÄ<X, Y> (a ‚âÉ b) ‚âÉ Œ£(f : Ts.mor(X, Y)
                    g : Ts.mor(Y, X)) (f ‚ñ∏ g = id) and (f ‚ñ∏ g = id)            
```

Exactly as we did for monoids, we can proceed to derive an unbiased definition
a lax prototype.
Mutatis mutandis, lax categories turn out to be virtual equipments.

# Displayed algebraic structures

The other nice thing is that since we have defined categories as models for an inductive type,
we automatically have the typeclass of displayed categories, and all algebraic typeclasses are instances of it:
```
Group : Cat·µà
Ring : Cat·µà
Cat : Cat·µà
```
Furthermore, we can iterate, and thus `Cat·µà : Cat·µà·µà`, etc. And since constructions and proofs also can be lifted,
any statement we have proven for all small categories `prf<C : Cat>` also can be applied to displayed categories,
say like the category `Grp : Cat·µà` of all groups and the category of all categories `Cat : Cat·µà` itself.

# Universes as categories

As we have seen above, not only inductive shapes have the notion of extensions; universes do as well.
It is not hard to see that it also applies to universes of type families, universes of fibered types,
and universes of fibered type families.
ÃàUniverses of fibered types or type families will also exhibit selectors if they are fibered
over self-fibered types.
It can be shown to also apply to universes of models for any given algebraic theory,
including infinitary algebraic theories with dependent sorts and their generalized form as long
their sort algebras are stratified. In fact, in all of these cases, the categories `ùí±` are also
equipped with proarrows (‚Äúmultivalued morphisms‚Äù) `s·µà t` for each `s t : ùí±`.

In this work we only considered dependent type formers valued in ordinary types, but it should
be possible to introduce dependent type formers in shape universes `$ùí∞` using an approach
modelled after ‚ÄúType Theory for Synthetic ‚àû-categories‚Äù by E.¬†Riehl and M.¬†Shulman.

# Promorphisms in universes of models

Displayed models for inductive types have the form
```
typeclass ‚Ñï·¥ø·µà <M : ‚Ñï·¥ø, this Ts : |M| ‚Üí *>
  zero : Ts(M.zero)
  next : ‚àÄ{n : M} Ts(n) ‚Üí Ts(M.next n)
```
allowing do define the type of induction motives and the induction operator:
```
def ‚Ñï·¥π<this P : ‚Ñï·µà> = ‚Ñï·¥ø·µà<‚Ñï, P>

‚Ñï-ind<P : ‚Ñï·¥π>(n : ‚Ñï) : P(n)
```

For each model `M : ‚Ñï·¥ø`, the inhabitants `Pm : ‚Ñï·¥ø·µà<M>` are promorphisms (many-to-many corresponcences,
sometimes also called weak homomorphisms) on `M` with the target given by
```
instance Pm.target : ‚Ñï·¥ø<M √ó Pm>
  zero: (M.zero, Pm.zero M.base)
  step: { n : M, x : (Pm n) ‚Ü¶ (M.step n, Pm.next (M.next n) x) }
```

We can single out homomorphisms as the functional (= many-to-one)
promorphisms `Œ£(src : ‚Ñï·¥ø<T>, pm : ‚Ñï·¥ø·µà src) (f : ‚àÄ(n) (m : (pm n)) √ó ‚àÄ(n' : pm n) n ‚âÉ m`,
making the type of ‚Ñï-models into a ‚àû-precategory (Segal type),
which turns out to be a ‚àû-category (Complete Segal type) as it is well-known that the equivalences `(‚âÉ)<‚Ñï·¥ø>`
of ‚Ñï-models correspond to their isomorphisms.

# S-ary parametricity and induced algebraic structure (Lax monoidal category example)
Universes of type families over a given shape (e.g. `(‚ñ°¬π)·µà`) admit internal universes of
(either strict or lax) models for every lax prototype.

In particular, we have prototypes `LaxMonoidPt / ‚ñ°¬π` and `LaxMonPt /À¢ ‚ñ°¬π` of lax and
strict `‚ñ°¬π`-indexed monoids.

For any prototypes over the same signature shape, we can build symmetric products,
e.g. the prototypes `CatPt ‚äô (LaxMonoidPt / ‚ñ°¬π)` and `CatPt ‚äô (LaxMonoidPt /À¢ ‚ñ°¬π)`
of lax and ordinary monoidal categories respectively.
