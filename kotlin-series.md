In course of the last two years, I've outlined a number of proposals for Kotlin regarding better type safety for coroutines, resource handling and DSLs, better expressiveness, and a syntactic facelift to reach into areas where Python currently dominates. The proposals are summarised in five short memos of 3-5 pages each.

- [Structured resource management](kotlin_objects.pdf): Like many other languages, Kotlin uses scope-based resource management. We outline how to improve a wide range of aspects of resource management, ultimately unifying structured concurrency and the lifetime-based approach pioneered in Rust.
- [Type-providers and metaprogramming](kotlin_meta.pdf): Embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs) in Kotlin can be used to synthesize data and functions, but not types. Overcoming this limitation requires type providers: compile-time functions that synthesize classes, interfaces, mixins, and type aliases. Type providers enable DSLs like embedded `SQL`.
- [Declarative Kotlin](kotlin_declarative.pdf): Declarative programming is an approach striving to enable describing what you want to get rather than how to get it. It facilitates concise, transparent, straight-to-the-point code and is an indispensable tool for tackling inherent complexity. We outline how to introduce declarative programming capabilities into Kotlin bringing the full power of functional logic programming (roughly “Haskell + Prolog”).
- [Literate Kotlin](kotlin_literate.pdf): Kotlin in its current form is not fully suited for literate programming and lags behind Python when it comes to illustrating ideas in tutorials and research papers. We draft a Kotlin variant for literate programming and academic / educational use as ‘runnable pseudocode’. Literate Kotlin, as we currently call it, can be seen as an alternative front-end to the same underlying language.
- [Academic Kotlin](kotlin_academic.pdf): Modified Literate Kotlin can be used for computer science papers and in mathematics as a language for constructions and proofs. These applications require dedicated extensions, we'll outline in this memo. High abuse potential makes some of them undesirable for a general-purpose programming language, so we propose introducing a separate dialect: Academic Kotlin.
