In course of the last two years, I've outlined a number of proposals for Kotlin regarding better type safety for coroutines, resource handling and DSLs, better expressiveness, and a syntactic facelift to reach into areas where Python and Lean currently dominate:

- [Structured resource management](kotlin_objects.pdf) (4 pages): Like many languages, Kotlin uses scope-based resource management. We outline how to improve resource management in Kotlin, ultimately revealing the common structure underlying structured concurrency in Kotlin and lifetime-based borrow checking in Rust.
- [Type providers](kotlin_meta.pdf) (2 pages): Embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs) in Kotlin can be used to synthesize data and functions, but not types. Overcoming this limitation requires type providers: compile-time functions that synthesize type definitions facilitating tremendously powerful type-safe DSLs such as embedded SQL.
- [First-class dependency injection](kotlin_deps.pdf) (1 page): We believe that the language should provide a specialised syntax to make dependency injection a drop-in replacement for the naïve singleton-based approach with no syntactic penalty.
- [Controlling effects](kotlin_purity.pdf) (1 page): In many cases, high-order functions such as `sortWith(comparator)` only have meaningful behaviour if their arguments are pure functions. Type-level control over the purity of functions and data is essential to prevent nonsensical behaviour and dangerous vulnerabilities.
- [Declarative Kotlin](kotlin_declarative.pdf) (2 pages): We outline how to seamlessly integrate declarative programming capabilities embracing the full power of functional logic programming (roughly “Haskell + Prolog”).
- [Literate Kotlin](kotlin_literate.pdf) (4 pages): Kotlin in its current form is not optimized for literate programming and lags behind Python when it comes to illustrating ideas in tutorials and research papers. We develop an alternative syntactic front-end for these usages.
- [Academic Kotlin](kotlin_academic.pdf) (4 pages): Literate Kotlin extensions dedicated to applications in computer science and in pure mathematics.
